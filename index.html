        <p> My hobby is reading intresting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and I read in 7th standard. Now I know that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us diciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>
